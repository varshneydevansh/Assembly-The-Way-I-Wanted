# Assembly-The-Way-I-Wanted
How to actually learn programming and being able to think

**I know I know you guys be like hey you already started those other: I wanted series what about that?**

To be honest back in somewhere in 2017 I looked for how could I be able to think and write programatically my thoughts well and back in clode to 2017 I knew that Assembly is the first beginning aside mathematics.

But, there were things going on with me and as an early explorer I kept loosing myself and leaving things as soon as I started something. After pandemic life went in entirely other direction and I went through a lot. Luckily I was able to find myself and now I am ready to do what I really wanted to do learning and explaining stuff. I did started from January where I started uploading YouTube videos about STEM topics starting with Programming and DSA.

I am now going to complete this series first and then I will move to Computer Networking and the API The Way I wanted and gradually other STEM stuff.
